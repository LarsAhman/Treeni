# Treeni
I had trouble remembering all the drills in my martial arts class 
a couple of years ago and got the idea for this project. You can create a 
"movement", like "Mawashigeri-kick" add tags to it, like "Kick" and "Sidekick" 
and grade its difficulty. Afterwards you can filter your database using search terms, 
tags and difficulties. Right now a linebreak messes up the savefile and I'm working on it.
